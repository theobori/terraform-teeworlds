## üí• How to start chaos ?

There is a [`examples`](./examples) folder where you can find a terraform project.

You could run it with the following command from the project root folder.

```bash
terraform -chdir=./examples apply
```

You should also create a Teeworlds server (only tested on 0.7 version) with a similar configuration.

```bash
# Econ configuration
ec_port 7000
ec_password "hello_world"
ec_output_level 2

# Override server configuration
sv_register 0
sv_map ctf1
sv_gametype ctf
```

Now you can build and run the Go application, check the `-h` or `--help` flag if needed.
